                I never thought Blog.phia would live to see the day. The second post in the collection of <a class="borzoitest" href="../vibe-study-0/index.html">"Vibe Studies"</a> I promised to keep up will be dedicated to my unpacking of what we <i>might</i> mean when we say "vibes," and what that <i>might</i> mean for us.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-body">I've developed an automatic trigger-response when I read or hear the word "vibes." Especially now that I've been getting the vibration way more frequently and at a slightly different tune: We've seen a recent uptick in the use of "vibes" in our daily conversation, online discourse, and daily online discourse about AI (heard of "vibe coding?"). I've also observed AI users, researchers, and tech journalists use the term to describe AI-generated outputs and behaviors of AI-mediated systems. Fascintating...</p>

            <div class="image-plus-desc">
                <img class="blog-image" src="./vibecheck_by_every.png" alt="my newsletter from every on ai called vibe check">
                <p class="image-desc">One of my tech e-newsletters is from <a class="borzoitest" href="https://every.to/" target="_blank">Every</a> that publishes a series on new model releases they've very aptly called <a class="borzoitest" href="https://every.to/vibe-check" target="_blank">"Vibe Check."</a></p>
            </div>

            <p class="blog-body">The truth is, I think about vibes a lot. From my website, see the <a class="borzoitest" href="../../work/wvc/index.html">Whole Vibe Catalog</a>, <a class="borzoitest" href="../vibe-study-0/">"Vibe Study 0,"</a> and a quote from my first blog post ever from 2023, where I document my vibe-based AI playlist generator <a class="borzoitest" href="../../work/soph.ai/index.html">soph.ai</a>):</p>

            <p class="blog-body"><i>"When creating my own playlists using my brain and without AI, I'm often inspired by some hyperspecific 'vibe' from an earlier decade or era. I documented my very first hyperspecific-vibey-era playlist in another blog <a class="borzoitest" href="../moms-haiku/">post</a>."</i></p>
            
            <p class="blog-body">This is written proof that my vibing predates my AI-ing!</p>

            <p class="blog-body">I even recently took my study of Vibeology to a real, serious, and real serious computer science research <a class="borzoitest" href="https://ht.acm.org/" target="_blank">conference</a>, where I authored a <a class="borzoitest" href="../../work/agency_among_agents.pdf">paper on AI, vibes, and AI vibes</a> with <a class="borzoitest" href="https://shmuh.co/" target="_blank">Shm Almeda</a> (I'm obsessed with their vibe) and gave a 20-minute talk on our paper to hypertext, social media, and recommender system researchers from all over the world:</p>

            <p class="blog-body">I used to love vibes and having <a class="borzoitest" href="../../work/wvc/index.html">"[thing]core" moments</a>. Don't get me wrong, I still do, but the more I see "vibes" used in relation to AI, the more important I've been finding it to determine the vibes of the whole thing. Is it #goodVibez üòÅ or #badVibez üòî? I've also been associating the word "vibes" with another word: "algorithms." Check this out:</p>

            <p class="blog-body">OK, let's pause for a second. Without me sacrificing my valuable human effort and time to think of and write out an explicit definition for the word "vibes," were you able to get the vibe from all the examples I've given? Also, how many times will I say vibe in this post? If I had to guess just based off of vibes, I'd say ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">To get a better sense or vibe, I'd like to now hypertext our way back to the origins of our modern use of the word.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">Before diving into the Wikipedia page for "vibes," I'm going to postulate that our mainstream use of the term "vibes" to describe a general feeling, mood, aura, energy, "[thing]core", or <i>milieu</i> in the air started around the mid-1960s. The historical event that I hypothesize started it all was the release of "Good Vibrations" by the Beach Boys in 1966:</p>

            <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5t9KYe0Fhd5cW6UYT4qP8f?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe><br><br>

            <p class="blog-body">I'm going to hypertext my way into the history of vibes now, starting from the <a class="borzoitest" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Vibrations#Background_and_authorship" target="_blank">Background & Authorship section</a> of the Wikipedia page for the song:</p>

            <div class="image-plus-desc">
                <img class="blog-image" src="./beachboys_wiki.png" alt="brian wilson mom quote about vibes">
                <p class="image-desc">Huh, "authorship" has a nice ring to it. I like this too: "I had a lot of unfinished ideas, fragments of music I called 'feels.' Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I'd felt, and I planned to fit them together like a mosaic."</p>
            </div>

            <p class="blog-body">Quick but important side note: I just love <i>human</i> songwriters. They don't necessarily have to be singers that write their own songs, but there's just something about songs written from the perspective of songwriting as an art form and act of personal expression rather than just a $$$ scheme that just makes the music so much better. It makes the Background section of the song's wiki not only more interesting but possible in the first place. What would I do without music wikis?</p>

            <p class="blog-body">Now, inspired by a class I'm taking this semester, Data C104: Human Contexts and Ethics of Data at Berkeley, let's look at the Google <a class="borzoitest" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram" target="_blank">n-gram</a> viewer for our favorite word:</p>

            <div class="image-plus-desc">
                <img class="blog-image" src="./vibes_ngram.png" alt="ngrams for vibe, uptick starting mid 1960s">
                <p class="image-desc">Frequency of "vibes" in our English corpus over time. I think the pre-'66 hump might be from <a class="borzoitest" href="https://sophiawliu.com/blog.phia/the-whole-earth-catablog/#update-line-lecture" target="_blank">Timothy Leary's time</a>...</p>
            </div>

            <p class="blog-body">When Googling, the only reporting I saw on the use of the word was from a <a class="borzoitest" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/22/vibes-definition-slang-language-meaning" target="_blank">2023 Guardian article</a>. The article actually mentions the growing prevalence of "vibes" within the tech industry, though the example provided is from 2023, and is very much outdated given the speed at which tech evolves and takes on new trends. It was Canva's "Global Head of Vibe" position held by Chris Low, who was in charge of 60 employees called "vibies" in 2023. Their vibe team leads initiatives at the company dedicated to bettering the "vibes" among employees like lavish social events.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">I'd now like to document what I think is almost a proper "movement" underway as of September 2025. Shm and I are far from the only people to get into the AI vibes of it all.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">I'd like to spotlight some of my current #Fav informal researchers (would the better term be "influencers?" hmmm): starting with Adam Aleksic, also known as the <a class="borzoitest" href="https://www.instagram.com/etymologynerd/" target="_blank">@etymologynerd</a> on all socials and the author of <i>Algospeak: How Social Media is Transforming the Future of Language</i> (2025); Daisy Alioto of <a class="borzoitest" href="https://dirt.fyi/" target="_blank">Dirt Media</a> and the charmingly sardonic voice of the <a class="borzoitest" href="https://www.tasteland.fyi/" target="_blank">Tasteland</a> podcast duo; Chia Amisola, of course, who I've already spotlighted in our paper, <a class="borzoitest" href="https://youtu.be/iIqjUKBf5WE?feature=shared&t=273" target="_blank">talk</a>, and <a class="borzoitest" href="https://sophiawliu.com/blog.phia/the-whole-earth-catablog/#update-line-summer">another blog post</a>; and lastly but not leastly, <a class="borzoitest" href="https://www.charlesbroskoski.com/" target="_blank">Charles Broskoski</a>, founder of <a class="borzoitest" href="https://youtu.be/iIqjUKBf5WE?feature=shared&t=453" target="_blank">Are.na</a> and the <a class="borzoitest" href="https://www.are.na/editorial/here-for-the-wrong-reasons" target="_blank">hypertext node</a> that led me to Tasteland, my current favorite non-musical audio entertainment besides calling my friends.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">The truth is, this hyperlink-filled blurb is an extremely suboptimal way to convey this movement. The best way to properly extract meaning from this vibe on "vibes" is to experience it for yourself. I've experienced it, continue to experience it, and have already spent countless hours <i>actively</i> exploring and engaging with these people and their work, but the only way for you to truly get it is not a quick pre-curated compilation by me.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">Every time I talk about hypertext vs. algorithms, vibes, and AI with my friends, I find that they go off exploring on their own, and develop their own resonance with the movement through their personally authored path.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">I think, at the end of the day, vibes are about people, both the individual and the collective. And this, this is good vibes.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">Check out this Reddit comment about Steve Jobs' "utopian Scholastic" attitude:</p>

            <div class="image-plus-desc">

                <p class="image-desc">Did someone say "Utopian Scholastic?"</p>
            </div>

            <p class="blog-body">Before I dive into the <i>meaning</i> of this post, "Utopian Scholastic" is a vibe. Yes, I mean in the "[thing]core" sense. I've been waiting for the opportunity to talk about the <a class="borzoitest" href="https://cari.institute/" target="_blank">Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute (CARI)</a>!!! This collective of designers, researchers, and design-researchers are an "online community dedicated to developing a visual lexicon of consumer ephemera from the 1970s until now." They epitomize the collective, crowdsourced, manual, intentional, and human-curated labor that is just so evidently full of <i>love</i>. Take a look at CARI's documentation on the "Utopian Scholastic" vibe, or what they call, "aesthetic category". See the Are.na collection on their page, but also a playlist someone made for the exact vibe.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">I actually remember when I first started getting into the Utopian Scholastic vibe.</p>

            <div class="image-plus-desc">
                <img class="blog-image" src="./utopian_scholastic.png" alt="when i first discovered utopian scholastic" style="width: 30vw;">

                <img class="blog-image" src="./mainstacks.jpg" alt="main stacks library at uc berkeley" style="width: 30vw;">
                <p class="image-desc">See, whether I was frequenting Berkeley's Main Stacks library because of my Utopian Scholastic vibe around January 25th, 2024, or I was in my Utopian Scholastic vibe because of my frequenting of Main Stacks remains unclear. Perhaps... they're <i>intertwingled</i>. Co-produced, even.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="blog-body">This next one is a mic-dropper. Here's what I've just transcribed from the Tasteland episode with Charles Broskoski, where Daisy Alioto is describing her takeaways from "Cab" (her nickname for her friend Charles and a longtime fan of the podcast "I listen to every episode") talk-turned-essay "Here for the Wrong Reasons:"</p>

            <p class="blog-body"><i>[9:34] Daisy: The composite of a person's nodes forms their taste and identity, but, there's something that you, Cab, get at in why we pay attention to certain things and sort of collect them as nodes in our taste that is different from a sort of cynical and algorithmic view of taste which is that it's not that every person is pre-destined to collect certain knowledge ‚Äî you could even call it completionism ‚Äî but that our desire and attention falls to certain things because of the way that we feel about the person, place, or thing that introduces it to us, so in that way, taste is a lot more similar to love than it is to education. 
            </i></p>

            <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/1xqxzb3kqa6x60dDU9UlZo?utm_source=generator&t=562" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe><br><br><br>

            </p><br>

            <p class="blog-body">When I think of the Utopian Scholastic attitude described in the Reddit screenshot and by Daisy as she explains her interpretation of her friend's words, I think of my own friend, who I was texting about "Utopian Scholastic" and who is the same friend that asked me if I knew about Are.na in another screenshot above. We've grown apart over the summer and are currently not on speaking terms. That friend is, in fact, the person I have always thought of when I saw anything that sparked that <i>love</i> of learning that I think is best described by the Utopian Scholastic playlist's description:</p>

            <div class="image-plus-desc">
                <img class="blog-image" src="./playlist_desc.png" alt="utop schol playlist desc">
                <p class="image-desc">"This bright, info dense, kid-centric aesthetic was popular throughout the 90's via edutainment in PC games, TV, books, and museum exhibits. It embodies feelings of curiosity, discovery, and excitement for the seemingly infinite potentiality of the world wide web."</p>
            </div>

            <p class="blog-body">We first met in our first shared class: 8th grade Geometry, in which he was the teacher's pet and I despised him deeply.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">First, a quick but essential detour before I make the relevance of this brief oversharing of my personal life clear. As I mention in my talk, anything AI-generated runs the risk of losing meaning ‚Äî meaning to the "author" and meaning to the "reader." A quick thought experiment I like to pose is why we even go to art museums in the first place. Do you think you spend more time looking at the art itself or reading the small placard beside it? What about the special exhibits dedicated to specific artists and artistic and/or social movements with the walls of text on historical background? For me personally, I unintentionally spend more time reading the little placards and literal walls of text than actually looking at the art itself. It's just like how AI-generated or corporatized music would have less interesting Background sections on their song wikis.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">What about the people you associate with a certain song, artwork, genre, artistic style, or movement? What about the personal memories? I don't usually listen to music because it just "sounds good," though sometimes I do. Sometimes it just fits the "vibe" aesthetically and/or emotionally.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">Circulating on the internet are these AI-generated images and videos that encapsulate the "vibe" of some of CARI's aesthetic categories. I use the word "encapsulate" very intentionally here because this AI-generated <i>content</i> tends to less specific in terms of the exact year, setting, and style, usually hovering around the vaguely '80s-'90s metropolitan and suburban Americana that tugs at millennial and Gen-X heartstrings yearning for a nostalgic, "simpler" past. As a result of these powerful, often indescribable pangs of nostalgia, these posts gain a lot of measurable "engagement" in the form of likes, comments, and follows.</p>

            <div class="image-plus-desc">

            <p class="blog-body">From all these examples, we <i>feel</i> the rather complex tension between meaning and affect, resonance and denotation.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">I'm still grappling with this myself. With AI workflows and outputs, there's the ever-present risk of delegating too much intent to the algorithmic systems. Especially with our most recent developments towards the "Agentic Web," and the threat to collapse our decades of human love and labor that went into each blue link into compact and instant AI-summaries. Certain tasks will absolutely stand to benefit from this (like targeted queries - "'Good Vibrations' release date"), but perhaps less so for subjective, "love-based", thoughtful experiences that benefit from the inefficiency of <a class="borzoitest" href="../../work/agency_among_agents.pdf">"hypertextual friction."</a></p>

            <p class="blog-body">To experience this for yourself, open <a class="borzoitest" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Vibrations" target="_blank">the Wikipedia page for 'Good Vibrations'</a> and just start skimming from the top. What would you have missed out on if you got a direct answer to your question about the song? It's the accidental exploration, unique pathfinding, personal association with each associative link, and mindful browsing that we could stand to lose the more we delegate our agency to agents.</p>
                
            <p class="blog-body">At the same time, it can still be true that AI-generated and AI-curated (via diffusion models and recommendation algorithms) content can hold meaning for the prompter (analogous to the hypertextual author) and evoke meaning for the viewer (analogous to the hypertextual reader). As of now, all outputs are inherently human-derived and human-impacting (though not always user-serving), even if they are rapidly generated with scant thought from the prompter and merely the result of stochastic, quantitative, and objective processes, or in other words, the very opposite of human. The viewer still has no choice but to attach personal value and real lived experience regardless of the visual or conceptual depth of the work, as long as there are elements that identifiable, nameable, and describable.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">This might've been my most hypertextual blog post yet. I stand firmly behind my belief that #goodVibez emerge from intentional, mindful, love-based, and quite often <i>slow</i> engagement. Flow states aren't only possible with algorithms, next time, try falling down a hypertextual rabbit hole where you're the author of your experience.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">Blog.phia is deeply hypertextual, personal, and most of all, a love letter to my loved ones.</p>
