            <p class="blog-body">I'm finally writing the post I've been putting off for months! Since my mom has her own post, I figured my dad deserved one too. Just kidding, this is something I've been wanting to write since I thought of Blog.phia. It's a story I tell everyone whenever I get the chance because I'm so proud of it.</p>
                
            <p class="blog-body">My dad's currently busy working on who knows what in his favorite place, the garden, so I'm writing this purely from my memory of the many times he's recounted to me (at my request) his days as a physics PhD student at UC Santa Cruz in the late '80s and early '90s.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">My dad's particular subfield of physics was high energy or nuclear physics. As his avenue into the US, he researched subatomic particles under <a class="borzoitest" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2008/11/2532.html" target="_blank">Professor Don Coyne</a> who funded his student visa and other living expenses, so long as he assisted him in his research. They would take Prof. Coyne's Porsche two-seater from the wooden house he built himself in Bonny Doon through Highway 9 (the winding one lined with redwoods through the Santa Cruz Mountains and one of my favorites to drive through) to get to the Stanford Linear Accelorator Center, or SLAC.</p>

                <img class="blog-image" src="./dadsc.jpeg" alt="dad at uc santa cruz, gotta figure out which building this is">
                <p class="image-desc">Me: "Where is this?" Dad: "122 pounds!" Great, thanks, Dad. The physics department at UC Santa Cruz, the building most damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="blog-body">I haven't taken a single physics class in my entire life so excuse my lack of domain knowledge here: At SLAC, my dad worked the graveyard shift, monitoring the accelerator's acceleration (???) of electrons and positrons, colliding them with each other to the point of atomic breakdown, producing the subatomic d-star particle, his thesis' subject.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">This was great and all but even more fascinating to me was the production of another scientific finding that happened at the exact same time my dad hung out at SLAC: the birth of the very language I'm using to write this post: Hypertext Markup Language or HTML!</p>

            <p class="blog-body">To communicate their research progress with CERN (the European equivalent of SLAC) across the sea, scientists at SLAC used physicist Tim Berners-Lee's brand new invention called "HTML tags", to format their research — figures, paragraphs, headings, and all. Isn't that the coolest thing? As usual, Wikipedia does a better job than me of explaining things in depth, so check out <a class="borzoitest" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#History" target="_blank">the history of HTML</a>.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">I don't have a playlist for this but I do have a song (I always do)!<br><br>Since this is my dad's blog post, this is his song, as in, a song I love that reminds me of him, and especially his days at UC Santa Cruz. As a graduate student, my dad rented a room in his Aptos home to a painter who got paint all over his walls and carpet, and paid rent using his credit card. These lyrics from "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" by Bob Dylan (I saw him live two weeks ago!) fit that image in my mind exactly:
                <p class="blog-body" style="text-align: center;">
                    <i>The empty handed painter from your streets<br>
                        Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets</i>
                </p><br>
            </p>

            <p class="blog-body"><br>While I'm at it, another tenant worth mentioning is the Japanese chef specializing in French cuisine who had long hair and cut his toenails on my dad's front porch (no need for a trash can). We use his BBQ drumstick recipe to this day. Recipes blog post coming soon!</p>
