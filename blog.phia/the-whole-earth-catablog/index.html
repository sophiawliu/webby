                I'm not sure how it's possible to procrastinate on a blog post, especially one belonging to Blog.phia, my personal expressive outlet and little <a class="borzoitest" href="https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/a-literature-review-of-social-media-for-marketing/32191#:~:text=A%20retrospective%20term%20which%20emerged,consumption%20by%20a%20large%20audience." target="_blank">Web 1.0</a> corner of the Web 2.5 internet, yet here I am. It's because I've been brainstorming this post for a while now, adding more bullet points to that one Note on my iPhone I can never find. Somehow the pressure is on and the stakes are so low. Who reads this anyways?
            </p>
            <p class="blog-body">
                The Whole Earth Catalog means a lot to me, as if I couldn't make that any clearer on this website (see the <a class="borzoitest" href="https://sophiawliu.com/work/wvc/">Whole Vibe Catalog</a> and <a class="borzoitest" href="https://sophiawliu.com/blog.phia/superhuman-strength/">The Secret to Superhuman Strength</a>). As of May 2024, I am actually a proud owner of a <i>The Last Whole Earth Catalog</i> very cold off the press from 1971! I bought it off Thriftbooks for $40, the cheapest offer I could find, and though I wouldn't be able to hold it spine-side up without large yellowed pages flying everywhere, it's complete!
            </p>

                I first learned about the WEC as a sophomore in high school in 2020, when I was deep into my Steve Jobs phase (why am I admitting that?). Proof of that phase is my "Jobes" (Jobs... vibes?) playlist on Spotify. See I wasn't kidding, was I?

            <p class="blog-body"><br>He talked about it in his 2005 Stanford commencement address, where he famously quoted the final page of <i>The Whole Earth Epilogue</i> (the true "last" Whole Earth Catalog, though not the last of Stewart Brand's publications). "Stay hungry. Stay foolish." he said. He called it "Google in paperback form" before we had search engines.</p>

            <p class="blog-body"><br>I immediately Googled (ha) the quote and saved a picture of the classic Whole-Earth-style page: white <a class="borzoitest" href="https://fontreviewjournal.com/windsor/" target="_blank">Windsor</a> font on a space-black background. And did again two years later...</p>

                Four years later, as a sophomore at UC Berkeley, I attended a virtual talk hosted by the Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation given by designer-technologist <a class="borzoitest" href="https://juerglehni.com/" target="_blank">Jurg Lehni</a> on November 16th, 2023. Sitting uncomfortably in the noisy Free Speech Movement cafe with my Airpods in, I read the name "Stewart Brand" on Jurg's slides, thinking, "Isn't that the guy who-". After Googling (ha) him to confirm, I was delighted to discover that the entirety of the Whole Earth Catalog and subsequent Portola Institute publications had been <a class="borzoitest" href="https://wholeearth.info/" target="_blank">put online</a> since I last tried to access one two years ago to no avail.
            </p>

                <p class="image-desc"><a class="borzoitest" href="https://juerglehni.com/works/viktor" target="_blank">Jürg Lehni and Wilm Thoben, Two Legacies, SOMArts, San Francisco, 2014.</a></p>
            </div>
            <p class="blog-body">Half paying attention during his talk (since I was too busy Googling), I realize I hadn't actually looked at the art piece he was telling us about when Stewart Brand's name came up. This cybernetic map was drawn by a chalk-drawing robot and is actually a fantastic visualization of the history covered by historian Fred Turner's book <i>From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism</i> (which I also own and am barely halfway through, oops).</p>

            <p class="blog-body">I did watch the entirety of Turner's 2013 Keynote in Berlin, which is a great overview of the extremely complex and colorful evolution from the starry-eyed, egalitarian communalism of the '60s to the technocraticism of the '90s up until today.</p>
            <iframe class="youtube" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Py_P1_cHUE?si=lqm0R2l-DxJtr5xL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="blog-body"><br>Long video short: post World War II nuclear existential threat, DARPA military research and cybernetic principles employed in interdiscipline collaboration, all the while anti-Vietnam War protests and the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley, Buckminster Fuller's Whole Systems and <a class="borzoitest" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xrKR2YUyH8" target="_blank">geodesic domes</a>, the first image of the "Whole Earth", the creation of the Whole Earth Catalog, access to tools for the back-to-the-land movement and self-sufficiency, the failure of the communes (heterarchies aren't effective, unfortunately), the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (the WELL) and the first virtual communities, the Whole Earth Software Review, Wired Magazine, and finally, our interconnected world today. Phew.</p>
            <p class="blog-body">The key fact is that the people involved in the first movement were involved in the second. Turner notes the uniting features between the Whole Earth Catalog and the WELL: Technophilic, Reversionary, Communal, Alternative, and Empowering.</p>

            <p class="blog-body">Sorry, got a little sidetracked there but following the principles of <a class="borzoitest" href="https://vimeo.com/41776276" target="_blank">cybernetics</a> (from the Greek word meaning "steersman"), I'll course correct.</p>
            <p class="blog-body">After being reminded of Stewart Brand and the WEC in the fall, one winter break later, I found myself studying in a new corner of Berkeley's Environmental Design Library. Thirty minutes or so of "studying" later, I thought to look around at the books on the shelves nearby (we students tend to forget that libraries hold books and aren't just study spots).</p>
            <p class="blog-body">To my completely visceral surprise, the shelf behind my chair was an absolute gold mine of Whole Earth Catalogs in protective covers. I almost didn't believe the  real things were inside the covers until I opened one up.</p>
            <div class="image-plus-desc">

                <p class="image-desc">The first Whole Earth Catalog I pulled off the shelf on February 22nd, 2024.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="blog-body">And so re-initiated my journey into the Whole Earth!</p>
            <p class="blog-body">I returned to that shelf at least five times that semester, spending hours holding the catalogs up to my face, flipping through the massive pages, just to get close to the history I felt so immersed in. I even brought my parents to see them (I have a picture of me and the "Stay hungry. Stay foolish." page that I made my mom take but it's too embarrassing to upload right now).</p>
            <p class="blog-body">And add on top of that my reading of Alison Bechdel's three autobiographical novels that semester, ending with <i>The Secret to Superhuman Strength</i> which discussed the Whole Earth Catalog and Buckminster Fuller extensively. But that's <a class="borzoitest" href="https://sophiawliu.com/blog.phia/superhuman-strength/">another blog post</a>.</p>
            <p class="blog-body">Part of my journey was the discovery of Community Memory, another Berkeley special. Housed in Leopold's Records on Durant Avenue, <a class="borzoitest" href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/community-memory-precedents-in-social-media-and-movements/" target="_blank">Community Memory</a> was the first virtual bulletin board accessible via remote computer terminals. It was used by local musicians to promote their performances among other local advertisements and notices. The music-enthusiast community caught on really fast! As we do.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="blog-body">Then, of course, I had to see it for myself. This summer, my friend Vickie and I spent our one day together before she went back to New York at the Computer History Museum... of all places!</p>

                <p class="image-desc">Vickie and Computer Memory. I disobeyed the 'No touching' sign and pressed one of the keys. Oh no!</p>

            <p class="blog-body">To end this blog post, a quote by Ted Nelson, the man who coined the term <a class="borzoitest" href="https://sophiawliu.com/blog.phia/dads-blog/">"hypertext"</a>, from his 1974 book <i>Computer Lib/Dream Machines</i>:
                <p class="blog-body" style="text-align: center; font-family: windsor; font-size: 30px;">
                    EVERYTHING IS DEEPLY INTERTWINGLED. In an important sense there are no "subjects" at all; there is only all knowledge, since the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this world simply cannot be divided up neatly.
