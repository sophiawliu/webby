            <p class="blog-body">there's nothing i love more than an experience that can transport you another place, better yet, another time. my nostalgia more often takes the form of nostalgia for times i've never experienced, times whose eras and auras i've gleaned from movies, songs, books, and my favorite, my mom's descriptions of her childhood. in the summer of 2021, i found her stash of mementos in a sun-faded fila shoebox, among which i found a hand-bound booklet entitled "na lau'oli" ("singing leaves").</p>

            <p class="blog-body">no poetry critic, i tried my best to see this poem from her point of view. “her” being the 17-year-old who had written this haiku, probably rushing to get her homework done after school so she and her siblings could go play at their favorite arcade on the top floor of a waikiki hotel. i thought of the skyscraper she was imagining (maybe the arcade's hotel), the hawaiian summer nights, and of the world that was hers. the siblings crowding around to watch mtv on a friday night and neon lights flashing across on the screen, pacman, the <a class="borzoitest" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ml3nyww80">bananarama cruel summer music video</a>, and in the mainland american cities too, the madonna-wannabes walking among the gordon-gekko-lookalikes: the upwards-gazing 80s dreamers with stars in their eyes.</p>
            <p class="blog-body">on that day, i made my first era-specific playlist and found the perfect playlist cover on pinterest to match:</p>
